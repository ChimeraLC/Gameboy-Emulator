# Gameboy-Emulator

This is an emulator for the DMG-01 Nintendo Gameboy written in C. Currently, it only supports games that use MBC1 and MBC3 banking.

Usage: ./main.exe <.gb filename>

It requires SDL, does not yet support sound, and has a few bugs that are still to be worked out. Currently, the Super Mario Land game works reasonably well, but compatibility with other titles is limited.
