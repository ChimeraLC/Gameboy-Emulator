# Gameboy-Emulator

This is an emulator for the DMG-01 Nintendo Game Boy written in C. Currently, it only supports games that use MBC1 and MBC3 banking.

Usage: ./main.exe <.gb filename>

It requires SDL, does not yet support sound, and has numerous bugs that are still to be worked out. Currently, the Super Mario Land game works reasonably well, but compatibility with other titles is limited (in many cases nonexistant).
